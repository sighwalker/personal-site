I haven’t really written here this semester.

I’ll miss college so much. I’ll miss wing so much. Life is going to be different, and I will never have the happiness of being with such beautiful people ever again.

I will never walk by Rohan's room and watch him play Valorant all day again. Archith handed me his LED strip before leaving. I have the same strip. We have the same remote. I wish I went to his room and played pranks because I have the same remote.
