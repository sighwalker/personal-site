It has been a while. I deleted an entry from this blog, and the simple reason for that is that I do not like being hateful. I am no better sometimes than the people I dislike, and I hope that I can be better. Anyway, back to the present. I should really stop causing myself a week of misery during finals and actually study. 5th semester, and I am still not coming to terms with my own mediocrity. It sucks that I’m just above the average here, and not a “good” student, or a B grade overall.

I don’t think I deserve more, but it is scary to think about future prospects with this grade you perceive yourself to be.

New grades might be discovered at the end of this semester. Well, the semester has ended, but grades are yet to come. After five encounters with painstaking mundanity and inability to study consistently, I’ve come to the conclusion that desensitizing yourself to anything of note in your life that isn’t happy is probably not the right move. I simply do not feel bad or horrible, it’s more so that I do not wish to put effort into something that I don’t like.

I hope I have a better work ethic than this, I pray that I have a better work ethic than this.
