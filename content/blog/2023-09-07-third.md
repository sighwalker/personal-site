I think I decided that I’ll just not write for last week, but here I am, typing this out. This week has almost ended, and I have nothing to write about. Maybe I hate the past week the most.

We visited Mudit in Yashoda though, and it might have been the best outing ever. It was impromptu, for a mildly serious reason and we had the fun city life without actually living in a city. Is it even considered blogging if you’re forcing yourself to write for the sake of writing? There are no sleepy Sundays anymore, or so I think. There is backlog to cover, and I really don’t want these midsemesters to end up like the ones in 1-2. There is no new week. Now there is backlog.

PS: Midsems this time around did end up like the ones in 1-2.
