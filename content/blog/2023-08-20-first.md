This blog is probably going to be a culmination of everything that has transpired during my first 10 days on campus, let’s call it my first week on campus in my second year. I’ll try doing this every week. The semester has barely begun and certain events have transpired. We spent full nights in rooms crying and coping about SI, academics, life in general. There was a lot of stuff said, a lot of stuff I do not remember, but we move on.

Being in a wing with my friends is nice. I don’t think there is overt joy or happiness, it’s just one of those things where you can see life being nice and slow like it used to be in summer vacations of old. I pass my friends’ room sometimes and it’s nice to see them talking, joking, playing useless games or berating each other for not studying.

I think I’ll go finish my notes for now. I’m afraid that I’m desensitized to the workings of the world and the thoughts and feelings that control the society we live in. I miss home. I miss laundry. I love the freedom I have at college. Another day, another blog. Maybe I add to this later.
