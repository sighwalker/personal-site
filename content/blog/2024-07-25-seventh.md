Coming back to campus and coming to terms with the person I need to be at campus is hard. It is easy to forget commitments and forget calls and forget loved ones. I hope I’m there for my people when I need to be. I just hope it turns out okay. I need to write more, but I think I’ll go and have cake and something else before hitting the sack for tonight.
