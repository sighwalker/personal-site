College starts again tomorrow. Sigh. I think this time around, I’ll try improving myself. We all say that every time something new starts, in hope of some bearable constant to cling to. I’ve realized that wanting a constant now is futile as there is none. You just have to keep going, there is no rest. You just go and go and go until you cannot anymore and pray that you end up in a good place with the ones you love. 

Being answerable to no one but my own self is not a good thing, especially with my unwilling nature for everything under the sun. I think I have just become bad at stuff, or more accurately, worse than some years ago. So here we go again, as I try to be better. Surely a stoic approach to life is better than the existential nihilists we try to be.

It’s been a while since I sat down and wrote something here. College and life truly is weird. I expect to go about my days in a certain way, and I end up doing none of it in the way I intended it to be. Commitments is a comedic term to use, for I have many commitments every semester, each of which I end up forgetting or leaving unfinished by the end. I wonder how other people allocate importance to the tasks they have to perform. I should really be more productive and finish work on time. I think I will go and do some work than write here.
