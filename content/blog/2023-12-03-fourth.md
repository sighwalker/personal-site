Going home for Dussehra was weird. I really wanted to meet some people, but I ended up staying home all day and just pandering to my family using the excuse of post midsem tiredness as a break. I did give cruX re-inductions with no amount of seriousness this time around.

It might be the sleepiest I’ve been, these weeks after ATMOS. Post-fest fatigue hits hard, but it hits harder when Diwali is upcoming. The fact that the wing is also half-empty doesn’t help, either. I like campus when it’s empty, though. I think I also like it when the semester is nearing the end. Life sort of slows down, and I like staying in my room with my books open all day. Granted, I don’t study as much, but it’s something to like and love. Maybe I should have gone home for Diwali and not Dussehra.

Sigh. I can’t believe semesters fly by so quick, each one faster than the last. There is no God. There is no sleep, and there is no schedule.

Its astonishing how much people can mislead themselves to believe things are okay or they can “enjoy” a said thing. Its probably very ironic that I’m the one saying this, what with delusions and cope being high this semester, but I genuinely do not like the fact that people can overlook a general sense of nicety for the sake of showing off whatever useless bullshit they’re doing well in.
