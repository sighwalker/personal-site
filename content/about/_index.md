Hello. I am Tanay Garde, a 4th year student majoring in Electronics Engineering (minor in Computing) at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I like to think that I am a decent developer. I know that most of the opportunities I have are because I somehow landed myself in this college.

I spend a lot of time designing and editing stuff. I spend a lot of my remaining time playing video games, writing, or listening to music.
